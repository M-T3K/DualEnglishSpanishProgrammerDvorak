The Dvorak Layout but with sopport for some additional letters commonly seen in Iberian Languages.

Based on [this other layout](https://github.com/jayliu50/windows-programmer-dvorak/), it's a modified version of [ThePrimeagen's layout](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/keyboards/tree/master) which I personally find more enjoyable to use. On Windows you still need the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134). For Linux based or Macintosh systems, [ThePrimeagen's layout](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/keyboards/tree/master) also offers this keyboard layout. However, if you need access to a whole bunch of languages, you may use something like [this](https://github.com/asvd/programmer-dvorak-eu).
